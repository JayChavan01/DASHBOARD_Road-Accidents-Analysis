# Road Accidents Analysis
### Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to identify key trends, high-risk areas, and other actionable insights. By leveraging SQL, Excel, and Power BI, the analysis provides a comprehensive view of accident patterns to aid in decision-making and safety improvements.

### Key Features:
1. Data Processing and Transformation (SQL):  
   - Imported raw accident data into SQL for preprocessing.  
   - Applied data cleaning and normalization to ensure accuracy.  
   - Created SQL queries to extract insights, such as accident frequency by time, location, and cause.

2. Intermediate Analysis (Excel):
   - Used Excel for initial exploration and summarization.  
   - Built pivot tables and charts for a basic understanding of trends.  
   - Verified and cross-checked data from SQL for consistency.

3. Interactive Dashboard (Power BI): 
   - Designed an intuitive and interactive dashboard for stakeholders.  
   - Included visualizations such as:  
     - Accident Hotspot Maps: Highlighted regions with the most accidents.  
     - Time-Series Analysis: Displayed accident trends by month, day, and hour.  
     - Cause Analysis: Identified leading causes of accidents.  
     - Severity Distribution: Broke down accidents by severity levels (minor, major, fatal).  
   - Added slicers and filters for real-time drill-downs by location, time, or cause.

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- SQL:  
  - Used for querying, cleaning, and transforming raw datasets.  
  - Enabled trend identification and summarized insights.

- Microsoft Excel:
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis and validation.  
  - Created charts for initial visual representation.

- Power BI: 
  - Designed an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.  
  - Combined SQL and Excel outputs for dynamic visualizations.
